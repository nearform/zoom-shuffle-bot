# Zoom Shuffle Bot

This repo contains a Zoom Chatbot used to retrieve a randomized list of your current meeting's participants:

![Chatbot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5416572/152143409-12162c5f-210e-40a3-bf1b-aa0362612089.gif)

The bot will work for any logged-in meeting participant.

## Architecture

The app is an HTTP server (using Fastify) backed by a Postgres database for persisting data.

The server has three public endpoints:

- `/authorize` - called when the app is installed in a Zoom account, here we fetch an initial OAuth token for accessing
  Zoom's API
- `/hook` - used for handling event subscriptions (participant joined, participant left, meeting ended) and stores the
  state of active meetings in the database - when a meeting ends it's removed
- `/bot` - used for handling Chatbot calls (when a slash command is used or a direct message is sent to the bot), and
  responds with the randomized list of participants

Meeting participants might not necessarily be logged in, that's why the app is storing both the usernames (which may be
set for the current meeting only) and user ids of the logged-in users for looking up their active meetings.

To avoid privacy issues usernames stored in the database are encrypted using SHA256.

## Local development

### Requirements

- Node LTS
- docker
- docker compose

### Setting up the local environment

1. **Create the env file**

   `cp .env.sample .env`

   *the missing environment variables will come from the Zoom Chatbot setup in the next steps*ðŸ‘‡

2. **Startup the database docker container**

   `npm run db:up`

3. **Install packages**

   `npm install`

4. **Run the database migrations to initialize the database tables**

   `npm run db:migrate`

5. **Startup the local server with nodemon**

   `npm run dev`

   _node debugger is available on the default port 9229_

6. **Use ngrok to expose the local app**

   If you don't have ngrok installed, here you can find the setup instructions: [Ngrok install](https://ngrok.com/download)

   make sure to create an account and log in before proceeding with
   the following steps.

   `ngrok http 3000` - run this command to expose your local app running on port 3000

7. **Keep note of your public ngrok https url**

   we'll refer to it as `$PUBLIC_URL` in the following steps

### Setting up a Zoom Chatbot for development

1. Visit [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create) and create a new Chatbot in a private account
   (follow the instructions below and visit [docs](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/chatbot-app) for
   reference).

   _Some issues found with accounts created with a gmail.com email, refer to the troubleshooting paragraph._

2. In the `App credentials` tab:
   - copy the development `Client ID` and `Client secret` to your local `.env` file
   - fill in the `Redirect URL for OAuth` field with `$PUBLIC_URL/authorize` replacing `$PUBLIC_URL` with the ngrok http url
   - in you `.env` file set `REDIRECT_URL` to the same value
   - add the `$PUBLIC_URL` to the `OAuth allow list` - this is necessary for OAuth to work

3. In the `Information` tab fill in the `Developer Contact Information` section
4. In the `Feature` tab:
   - fill in the `Bot endpoint URL` field - this is the `$PUBLIC_URL/bot` endpoint
   - add a slash command (note: this has to be a value that is unique for the entire Zoom Marketplace)
     - add a "usage hint" named "skipme" and add its description: "Do not include me in the random list of participants"
   - enable `Events subscription` for all users in the account and subscribe to the following events:
     - End Meeting
     - Participant/Host joined meeting
     - Participant/Host left meeting
   - fill in the `Event notification endpoint URL` - this is the `$PUBLIC_URL/hook` endpoint
   - copy the `Verification Token` to your local `.env` file
   - copy the `Bot JID` to your local `.env` file (it will be generated when settings are saved)
     ![Feature tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5416572/152381946-e7cbc48b-849e-4b44-b698-05a5020ad85e.png)
5. In the `Scopes` tab add the `user:read:admin` scope - here's a reference description of the used scopes:
   ![Scopes Tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5416572/152153304-6fa14420-0ef5-49c3-9788-9e1de702516e.png)
6. Move on to the `Local test` tab and try installing the app locally (make sure that your app is running, publicly
   available and using the development secrets). You will be asked to authorize the app and if everything goes well
   you will be redirected to a new Zoom chat with your bot. You can re-install the app locally as many times as you need.

7. You can test the Chatbot in Zoom by:
   1. sending any message directly to the bot (anything you send here will trigger the bot, you can also type `skipme`)
   2. sending messages to a new/existing channel (`/SLASH_COMMAND_FROM_STEP_4` or `/SLASH_COMMAND_FROM_STEP_4 skipme`)
8. For development purposes, don't submit the app in the `Submit` tab. Keep it as a draft.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions are used for running tests in a controlled environment

## Continuous Delivery

Github Actions deploy the `master` branch to
Google Cloud Platform.

The Continuous Delivery workflow can be triggered manually in the `Actions` tab (the test database and Run instance have
to be removed manually).

To make the CD pipeline work, you need to set up the following secrets:

- `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`,
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`,
- `SQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`,
- `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`,
- `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`,
- `ZOOM_BOT_JID`,
- `ZOOM_REDIRECT_URL`,
- `ZOOM_VERIFICATION_TOKEN`

## Monitoring and logs

If deployed with GCP using the Continuous Delivery pipeline, the application metrics can be monitored in the [Cloud Run service details page](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/europe-west1/zoom-shuffle-bot/metrics?project=shuffle-zoom-bot).

The app utilizes Fastify's default logger, and the production logs are easily accessible using [GCP's Logs Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=resource.type%3D%22cloud_run_revision%22%0Aresource.labels.service_name%3D%22zoom-shuffle-bot%22?project=shuffle-zoom-bot).
Logs can be easily narrowed down to a specific commit deployment by filtering on revision names which consist of
`${SERVICE_NAME}-${COMMIT_SHA}`.

## Troubleshooting

During the setup and installation phase you can come across a few problems:

### Gmail issue

Since February 2022 are occurring some problems creating the bot using an account registered with the @gmail.com domain. The returned error is a generic `fail_register_robot_to_robot_service`. Using an account made using a non-Gmail account everything works well. https://devforum.zoom.us/t/getting-fail-register-robot-to-robot-service-error-while-saving-bot-url-in-features/64742

### Linux issue

Another little problem comes when the app is locally tested using Linux.
Authorizing the device redirects you to an unsupported page, and the bot is not added to your account.
In this case, try using windows or mac.

### Webhooks issue

If the bot stops working and always responds with "Sorry, you don't seem to be participating in any of the ongoing meetings", it can depend on a problem with the webhooks, in
fact, the tracking of the join and left of the meeting is tracked using the webhooks.

For local testing, it is enough to re-authorize the bot by clicking on the Add button in the Local test tab and trying again.

For the production environment, you can try to open the `publishable url` in a browser. The publishable url is available in the submit tab of the app configuration.
